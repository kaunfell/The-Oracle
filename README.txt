The Oracle

https://oraclewonders.com/


I wanted to create magic 8 ball themed page which would answer to different questions.
The idea for this came perhaps from Codecademy's lessons but also I remember one site
called Lintukoto from my childhood. It had simple style but it was possible to ask
questions and you could see all of them and the answers on some container. The page 
had also some other simple games. 

I have been building this page and improving it, adding better logic to it, make 
it anwser to different question types and it also has two small text adventures.

Also, I found out how to add custom domain to GitHub pages, how to add https instead of just http 
and some other new things to me. 

Now(4.1.2024) I am coming back to see my code and I am seeing lots of things that
could have been done easier way, but that is the fun of working with a project and improving and learning! 
The question is, do people normal modify the code or just start over with the parts that
are working smoothly..

I did use Youtube, some pages and GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT making this site at the beginning, but
nowadays I like to achieve things more on my own, but these 2 tools provide sometimes valuable information.
Also I got help with how to make the eyes move and put modified sprite over it.



Things to add:


-Music
-Better Media Queries

----------------
Oracle and dragon sprites: made with free tool.
Other sprites by me.
